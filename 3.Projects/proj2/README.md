This Application is based on 2D tile-based game. The goal of this project is to teach you how to handle a larger piece of code with little starter code in the hopes of emulating something like a product development cycle. The application generates an explorable world and player should be able to walk around and interact with it. Please see [course website](https://sp18.datastructur.es/materials/proj/proj2/proj2) for more information and below for a quick demo.
